# py_project

Plan:
- Create script for scraping books information of interest: Title, Author, Description, Rating, Number of pages. www.goodreads.com is used as an test example. 
Done via BeautifulSoup. Rather slow for scraping the whole site, worth trying Scrapy.

To do (depending on time availability):
- Try classification model to identify book category based on description
- Try book search/recomendation based on short description/request.
